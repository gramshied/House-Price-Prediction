# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Objective
To build predictive models that estimate house prices
based on various property features.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as location, size,
number of rooms, and construction year.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train-test split
- Model training using Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score

## Results
- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression
- Key features influencing price were identified

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow,
from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
